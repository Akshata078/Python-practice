# While loop :-  loop as long as variable is true
# in while loop we check a condition, the while loop run uptill our condition is true, when we get any falsy value or our condition get false then our loop will end there only.
# in this, for condition we can use parenthesis or we can also  write the condition without parenthesis

# syntax - 
# while condition :
#     code
#     increment or decrement



# number = 1
# while number <= 10:
#     print(number)
#     number += 1

# print("while loop ends")



# even number

# number = 1
# while number <= 10:
#     if number%2 == 0 :
#         print(number)
#     number += 1  # this is not the part of if statement here, this is the part of while loop




# game - guess the number

# number = 19
# guess = 0
# attempt = 0

# while guess != number :
#     guess = int(input("Guess a number : "))
#     attempt += 1

# print(f"You guessed it right ! in {attempt} attempts")
