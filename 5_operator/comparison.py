# 1.  > (greater than) :- It will give output as True or False.  If the first value is grater than the second value then print True otherwise False

# print(5 > 2)  # True
# print(1 > 9)  # False
# print("5" > 3)  # error - in python we can not compare string to number, means we can not compare one data type to another data type
# print(True > False)  # True - The value of True is 1 and value of False is 0, so 1 is greater than 0, thats why True
# print(False > True)  # False
# print(True > 0)  # True  - True will converted to 1 then it will compare
# print("apple" > "mango")  # False - it will compare  by its ascii value. here ascii value of a is less tha ascii value of m. 
# In string, while comparing if we are comapring two words then it will check letter by letter means firstly it will check first letter of both the words and compare


# 2.  < (less than) :- It will give output as True or False. If the first value is less than the second value then print True otherwise False

# print(2 < 6)  # True
# print(2 < 1)  # False
# print(True < False)  # False
# print(False < True)  # True
# print(False < 1)  # False will converted to 0 then it will compare




# 3. >= (greater than or equal to)  :- if first value is greater than 2nd value or if it is equal to 2nd value then it will print True otherwise False

# print(2 >= 2)  # True
# print(1 >= True)  # True - value of True is 1 and it is equal to 1





# 4. >= (less than or equal to)  :- if first value is less than 2nd value or if it is equal to 2nd value then it will print True otherwise False

# print(1 <= 2)  # True
# print(1 <= True)  # True - value of True is 1 and it is equal to 1




# 5. == (equal to equal to OR double equal to)  :- It will check that the value is exactly same or not. if it is same then print True otherwise False

# print(2 == 2) # True
# print(5 == 3) # False
# print(5 == "5") # False
# print(True == False) # False
# print(True == 1) # True

# 5. != (not equal to)  :- It will check that the value is not same. if it is same then print False otherwise True


# print(2 != 2) # False
# print(5 != 3) # True
# print(5 != "5") # True
# print(True != False) # True
# print(True != 1) # False





# ord() :- to check the ascii value of any character or speacial character

# print(ord("A"))  # 65
# print(ord("a"))  # 97
# print(ord("#"))  # ascii value of # is 35
