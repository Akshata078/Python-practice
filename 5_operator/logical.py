# Logical Operators

# 1. Logical AND : True if both the operands(conditions) are true  [all conditions should be satisfy] - x and y 

# ssc = 85.80
# poly = 91.21

# if ssc >= 60 and poly >= 60 :
#     print("Eligible for admission in BTech")
# else :
#     print("Not Eligible")




# 2. Logical OR : True if either of the operands(conditions) is true [any one of the condition should be satisfy] - x or y

# ssc = 85.80
# poly = 91.21

# if ssc >= 60 or poly >= 60 :
#     print("Eligible for admission in BTech")
# else :
#     print("Not Eligible")




# 3. Logical NOT : True if operand(condition) is false and False if operand(condition) is true [if the condition is true then we get output as false, and if the condition is false then we get output as true] - not x

# ssc = 85.80
# poly = 91.21
# criminal = False

# if not criminal:
#     print("Eligible")
# else :
#     print("not eligible")
