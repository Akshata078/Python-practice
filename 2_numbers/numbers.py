num1 = 5   # integer

# Operation on numbers

print(num1 + num2)  # addition of two numbers

print(num1 - num2)  # subtraction of two numbers

print(num1 * num2)   # multiplication of two numbers

print(num1 / num2)  # num1 is divided by num2  - output : 2.0
# if we are performing division, then it will always give the output in decimal form means in float.


 
# if we want our result in integer form

print(num1 // num2) 

# here if any one number between two are float then we get output in float only.
# if both the numbers are integer then we will get output in integer 



print(2 ** 3)  # 2^3 = 2*2*2 = 8   for getting power 

print(6 % 4)  # for remainder   - in this also, if any one number between two is float then we will get output as float. if both numbers are integer then we get output as integer




# num1 += 3   # num1 = num1 + 3

# num1 -= 3   # num1 = num1 - 3

# num1 *= 3   # num1 = num1 * 3

# num1 /= 3   # num1 = num1 / 3

# num1 //= 5   # num1 = num1 // 5
