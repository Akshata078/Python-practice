# implicit conversion :- python will automatically convert one data type to another


# x = 5 # int - in this python will automatically convert 5 to 5.0 that is float
# y = 2.5 # float
# sum = x + y
# print(sum)   # output : 7.5
# print(type(sum))  # float



# while performing division on numbers, python will first convert the number into float 

# a = 4  # int  - python convert it into float i.e. 4.0 while doing division it will not change its original variable value that is 4, a ka value 4 hi rahega
# b = 2  # int  - python convert it into float i.e. 2.0 while doing division it will not change its original value that is 2
# result = a / b
# print(result)  # 2.0
# print(type(result))  # float
