# break statement :- whenever condition get true, our loop will stop there only
# break statement stops the entire process of the loop (break statement exits the loop entirely)


# break statement in for loop

# for x in range(10):
#     if x == 5 :
#         break
#     print(x)




# break statement in while loop

# num = 1

# while (num <= 10) :
#     if(num == 5):
#         break
#     print(num)
#     num += 1




# guess a  number
